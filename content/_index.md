# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}




I'm turning a career full of task and requirements management into one of writing and managing code as a full-stack software developer. 

One of my interests is in Bitcoin development and learning more about distributed peer-to-peer networks. Since 2017, I've been an observer of and participant in the Bitcoin network. The idea that a peer-to-peer network of computer nodes can store and secure a global ledger and facilitate digital scarcity (double-spend problem) continues to fascinate me. Lately, I've been hosting a full node and experimenting with the Lightning network, a layer 2 network facilitating real-time payments.
